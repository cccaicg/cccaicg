# RQ2
This directory contains the code to modify the function prompt and some examples.

## Code
You can get the modified function prompts by following the steps below:

1. Put the clone folder in this directory. For example, the clone folder in this repo is **data**, and you should keep the structure consistent between your clone folders.
2. Add your word to the file **my_dict.txt**.
3. Replace the values of the parameters with your own ones.
    - the variables between line 45 and line 51 of **main.py**
    - the OpenAI API key to access the gpt4o in line 49 of  **comment_tools.py**
4. Run **main.py** to get modified prompts.
