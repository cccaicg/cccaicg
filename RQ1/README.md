# RQ1

This directory contains the code for our RQ1.

**func/**

This directory shows the dataset we collect, which contains 84,000 prompts.

​	You can use the code **extract_functions.py** to extract the valid functions and the corresponding prompts for AI code generators to complete.



**clone detector/** 

This directory contains the clone detectors used in our paper.

​	For Type-1 and Type-2 clones, we use NiCad. We recommend you use this detector in Linux, which is faster than in Windows. For the detailed usage, please refer to the official website of NiCad: [Txl Home Page](https://www.txl.ca/txl-index.html).

​	To detect Type-4 clones, you can download the model we trained and use the script we provided. Please refer to the link below to download the models: [data and models (zenodo.org)](https://zenodo.org/records/13764043).

​	After finishing the process above, you should collect the function blind XML generated by NiCad and the Type-4 clone detection results generated by deep learning models to calculate the syntax similarity.



**result/**

We provide the whole experimental results in this directory to facilitate reproducing our results in Table 1 and Table 2.

​	Due to the size limit of GitHub, we are not able to upload our data directly; please refer to the link below to download our data: [data and models (zenodo.org)](https://zenodo.org/records/13764043).

After downloading data, you can extract them here and run   **calculate_final_answers.py** to reproduce the results in our paper.
